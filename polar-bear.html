      The polar bear is a hypercarnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, 
      encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. 
      It is the largest bear species, as well as the largest land carnivore. 
      Polar bears are the only species known for hunting humans.
